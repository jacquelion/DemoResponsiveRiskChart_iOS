# DemoResponsiveRiskChart_iOS
iOS version of Responsive Risk Chart

Clone this repository, and launch the Xcode project file from Xcode. 

You can run this either in a simulator with a device of your choice, or sync to your own device. 

Note: This project incorporates the files from my other repository, DemoResponsiveRiskChart. These files have already embedded in the Xcode Project folder of this repository.
